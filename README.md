# 🤖 AI-Powered Automated Grading System for C++ Code



## 📋 Project Overview

An intelligent automated grading system that leverages multi-agent AI architecture to evaluate student C++ programming assignments with human-level accuracy. The system employs advanced LangChain orchestration, OpenAI's GPT models, and an intuitive Streamlit interface to provide consistent, detailed, and fair grading at scale.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

- **Automate Code Evaluation** - Reduce manual grading workload for instructors
- **Ensure Consistency** - Provide objective and standardized assessment across all submissions
- **Deliver Detailed Feedback** - Generate comprehensive explanations for scores and improvement suggestions
- **Scale Efficiently** - Grade multiple submissions simultaneously without quality degradation

## 🚀 Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Analysis Agent** - Comprehensive code analysis and comparison with reference solutions
- **Evaluator Agents** - Independent grading based on rubric criteria
- **Meta-Evaluator Agent** - Quality control and fairness verification
- **Voter Agent** - Consensus-based score aggregation
- **Optimizer Agent** - Score refinement and normalization

### Dual Workflow System
- **Parallelization Workflow (Voting Mechanism)** - Multiple independent evaluators with median-based consensus
- **Sequential Optimization Workflow** - Iterative refinement with meta-evaluation

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** - Enhanced reasoning and accuracy
- **Few-Shot Learning** - Context-aware grading examples
- **LangChain Integration** - Robust agent orchestration and state management
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration** - State-of-the-art language understanding

### Interactive Interface
- **Streamlit Web App** - User-friendly interface for submission and results
- **Real-time Grading** - Instant feedback generation
- **Visualization** - Score breakdowns and performance metrics



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### AI & ML
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Advanced language model for code understanding
- **LangChain** - Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Python 3.10+** - Core programming language

### Frontend & Interface
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web application framework
- **Plotly** - Data visualization and charts

### Development Tools

## 🔄 Grading Workflows

### Workflow 1: Parallelization (Voting Mechanism)
1. **Analysis**: Code analyzed against reference solution
2. **Independent Evaluation**: Multiple agents grade simultaneously
3. **Voting**: Median score calculated from all evaluators
4. **Meta-Evaluation**: Quality control verification
5. **Optimization**: Final score refinement

### Workflow 2: Sequential Optimization
1. **Initial Evaluation**: First-pass grading
2. **Meta-Evaluation**: Quality assessment and feedback
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Score optimization based on meta-feedback
4. **Final Output**: Optimized grade with detailed justification

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Grading Accuracy**: Comparable to human instructors
- **Processing Time**: Real-time evaluation (< 30 seconds per submission)
- **Consistency**: Standardized assessment across all submissions
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple concurrent grading sessions
